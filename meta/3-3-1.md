  Total uninfected person_years of exposure Method of measurement Longitudinal
  data on individuals are the best source of data but are rarely available for
  large populations. Special diagnostic tests in surveys or from health
  facilities can be used to obtain data on HIV incidence. HIV incidence can also
  be modelled using the Spectrum software. Method of estimation Modelling is
  currently used to estimate new infections and incidence. Prevalence data
  inform these models.

  NOTE: Data include persons with a diagnosis of HIV infection regardless of
  stage of disease at diagnosis.  Data are presented for diagnosis of HIV
  infection reflect the date of diagnosis (by Dec 31, 2017) and reported to CDC
  as of June 30, 2018, not the date of report to CDC.  Data for the year 2017
  are preliminary because they are based on only a 6-mo reporting delay. 
  Therefore, trends should only be assessed using data through the year 2016 to
  allow sufficient time (at least 12 months) for reporting of case information
  to CDC to accurately assess trends.

  Revised time series reflect SME-suggested revisions.
