  The national recycle rated is the proportion of material recycled or composted
  from all municipal solid waste generated

us_method_of_computation: >-
  National tonnage totals for Municipal Solid Waste are characterized in the
  Advancing Sustainable Materials Management: Facts and Figures report.  The
  total tonnage of materials recycled and those composted are added together.
  This sum is then divided by the total of all material waste generated.  Full
  methodology on how tonnages are calculated is located:

  The rate is a percentage, derived from a portion of all municipal solid waste
  generated in tons

  The Advancing Sustainable Materials Management: Facts and Figures report
  includes annual municipal solid waste management metrics dating from
  1960-2015.
