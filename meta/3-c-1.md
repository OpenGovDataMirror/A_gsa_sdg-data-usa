  by percentage of total population in urban areas.

  Data come from 2017-2018 Area Health Resources Files (AHRF), which
  incorporates several data sources at the aggregated level. Physician
  information, including non-federal doctors of medicine (M.D.) and doctors of
  osteopath (D.O.), is from the American Medical Association Physician Master
  file. Physician assistant and advanced practice registered nurse (including,
  nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, certified registered nurse
  anesthetists, and advance practice nurse midwife) data are from the Centers
  from Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) National Provider Identification
  (NPI) File. The Administrative Simplification provisions of the Health
  Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) mandated the
  adoption of standard unique identifiers for health care providers and health
  plans. The NPI is a unique identifier developed by CMS. Covered health care
  providers and all health plans and health care clearinghouses must use the
  NPIs in the administrative and financial transactions adopted under HIPAA. The
  2010 Population information is from 2010 Census Redistricting Data (Public Law
  94-171) Summary File, The 2011-2016 Population Estimates are from the Census
  Bureau and include the calculated number of people living in an area as of
  July 1. The estimated population is calculated from a components of change
  model that incorporates information on natural change (births, deaths) and net
  migration (net internal migration, net international migration) that has
  occurred in an area since a Census 2010 reference date for 2011-2016
  estimates.  Metro/non-metro classification is from Census Bureau and defined
  based on the Office of Management and Budgetâ€™s 2017 delineation of
  Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Area. The 2017 updates are based on
  the applications of the 2010 Standards for Delineating the Metropolitan and
  Micropolitan Statistical areas to Census population estimate for July 2014 and
  July 2015.
