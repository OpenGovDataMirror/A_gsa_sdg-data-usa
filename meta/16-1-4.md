  The results are based on telephone interviews with a random sample of adults,
  age 18 +, living in the U.S. The interviews are conducted with respondents on
  landline telephones and cell phones with a minimum quota of 50% cell phone and
  50% landlines respondents, with additional quota by region. Phone numbers are
  selected using random digit dial methods. Landline respondents are chosen at
  random within each household based on the adult with the most recent birthday.
  Samples are weighted to correct for unequal probability of selection,
  non-response, and double coverage of landline and cell users in two sampling
  frames. All estimates are subject to sampling error. Each year, the margin of
  error is approximately +/- 4 percentage points at the 95% confidence level.

  National Crime Victimization Survey, conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau for
  the Bureau of Justice Statistics, does not collect this information; however,
  as part of methodological work for the NCVS redesign, the BJS will be
  conducting a field test of the new questionnaire and different collection
  modes. The redesigned questionnaire includes an item similar to that used by
  Gallup: Is there any place within a mile of your home where you would be
  afraid to walk alone at night? [ ] Yes   [ ] No. The field test is expected to
  be completed in the fall of 2020.
