graph_title: Carbon Dioxide Emissions in Metric Tons per Million Chained (2012) Dollars
indicator_definition: >-
  CO2 emission per unit of value added is a ratio indicator between the carbon
  emission and value added. Carbon emission is estimated from the data on energy
  consumption.
indicator_name: CO2 emission per unit of value added

periodicity: Annual
published: true
rationale_interpretation: >-
  Carbon emission per unit of value added is a universal indicator for measuring
  the impact of industrial production on environment. It captures the intensity
  of energy use, energy efficiency of production technology and most importantly
  use of fossil fuels. This indicator can also be presented as CO2 emission per
  unit of output.
