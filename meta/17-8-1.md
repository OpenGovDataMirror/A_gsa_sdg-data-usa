indicator_definition: >-
  This indicator is defined as the proportion of individuals who used the
  Internet from any location in the last three months. The Internet is a
  worldwide public computer network. It provides access to a number of
  communication services including the World Wide Web and carries e-mail, news,
  entertainment and data files, irrespective of the device used (not assumed to
  be only via a computer _ it may also be by mobile telephone, tablet, PDA,
  games machine, digital TV etc.). Access can be via a fixed or mobile network.
  For countries that collect data on this indicator through an official survey,
  this indicator is calculated by dividing the total number of in-scope
  individuals using the Internet (from any location) in the last 3 months by the
  total number of in-scope individuals. For countries that have not carried out
  an official survey, data are estimated (by ITU) based on the number of
  Internet subscriptions and other socioeconomic indicators such as for example
  GNI per capita, and on the time series data of the indicator.

rationale_interpretation: >-
  The Internet has become an increasingly important tool to access public
  information, which is a relevant means to protect fundamental freedoms. The
  number of Internet users has increased substantially over the last decade and
  access to the Internet has changed the way people live, communicate, work and
  do business. Internet uptake is a key indicator tracked by policy makers and
  others to measure the development of the information society and the growth of
  Internet content ' including user-generated content ' provides access to
  increasing amounts of information and services. 

  Despite growth in networks, services and applications, information and
  communication technology (ICT) access and use is still far from equally
  distributed, and many people cannot yet benefit from the potential of the
  Internet. This indicator highlights the importance of Internet use as a
  development enabler and helps to measure the digital divide, which, if not
  properly addressed, will aggravate inequalities in all development domains.
  Classificatory variables for individuals using the Internet ' such as age,
  sex, education level or labour force status ' can help identify digital
  divides in individuals using the Internet. This information can contribute to
  the design of targeted policies to overcome those divides. 

  The proportion of individuals using the Internet is an established indicator
  and also one of the three ICT-related Millennium Development Goal (MDG)
  indicators (for Target 8F). It is part of the Partnership on Measuring ICT for
  Development's Core List of Indicators, which has been endorsed by the UN
  Statistical Commission (last time in 2014). It is also included in the ITU ICT
  Development Index, and thus considered a key metric for international
  comparisons of ICT developments.
